This is very specific to the pentacene system. Perhaps I can make it general, but that seems more exhaustive than I want.
How to run:
- Copy into 'master' folder
    - epsilon_template
    - sigma_template
    - kernel_template
    - absorption_template
    - bgw_automation.py
    - bash_script_3.sub
    - all structures
            NOTE: structures need to be labelled struct_x, where x are integers starting from 1 and going up.

- In bgw_automation.py change:
 - number of structures
 - template names
 - output names
 - first qpoint weight (epsilon)
 - first qpoint shift (epsilon)


- In bash_script_3 change:
    - Cores
    - number of calculations (number of structures)

Make sure all parameters are what you want them to be, then run bgw_automation.py.
NOTE: If you've already ran this once, either comment out the linking section or delete all of your folders. Otherwise there will be an error.
