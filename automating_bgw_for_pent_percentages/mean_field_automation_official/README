This is very specific to the pentacene system. Perhaps I can make it general, but that seems more exhaustive than I want.
How to run:
- Copy into 'master' folder
    - bands_template
    - kgrid_template.inp
    - scf_template.in
    - pw2bgw_template.inp
    - mean_field_automation_pt1.py
    - mean_field_automation_pt2.py
    - bash_script_1.sub
    - bash_script_2.sub
    - all structures
            NOTE: structures need to be labelled struct_x, where x are integers starting from 1 and going up.

- In mean_field_automation_pt1.py change:
 - parameters ~ WFN, WFNq, and WFN_fi
 - parameters ~ pw2bgw.x
 - number of structures

- In mean_field_automation_pt2.py change:
 - nbnb ~ bands.in
 - number of structures

- In bash_script_1 change:
    - Cores
    - number of calculations (number of structures)

- In bash_script_2 change:
    - Cores
    - number of calculations (number of structures)

Make sure all the parameters are what you want them to be. Then you run pt1.py, wait for the calculations to finish, then run pt2.py.
